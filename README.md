# pi‑carplay

pi‑carplay brings Apple CarPlay functionality to the Raspberry Pi.
While it started as a fork of react-carplay, it has since evolved into a standalone implementation with a different focus.

🎯 Optimized for embedded Raspberry Pi setups and ultra-low-resolution displays

> **Requirements:** A Carlinkit **CPC200-CCPA** (wireless & wired) or **CPC200-CCPW** (wired only) adapter.


## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/f-io/pi-carplay.git
cd pi-carplay
./setup-pi.sh
```

The `setup-pi.sh` script will:

1. Install required dependencies
2. Configure udev rules
3. Download the latest AppImage
4. Create an autostart entry

### 🧱 System Requirements

Make sure the following packages and tools are installed on your system before building:

- **Python 3.x** (for native module builds via `node-gyp`)
- **build-essential** (Linux: includes `gcc`, `g++`, `make`, etc.)
- **libusb-1.0-0-dev** (required for `node-usb`)
- **libudev-dev** (optional but recommended for USB detection on Linux)
- **fuse** (required to run AppImages)

### 🔨 Clone & Build

```bash
git clone --branch main --single-branch https://github.com/f-io/pi-carplay.git \
  && cd pi-carplay \
  && npm install \
  && npm run build \
  && npm run build:armLinux
```

### 🍎 Mac Requirements (experimental, ARM only)
For microphone support, install sox via Homebrew:
```bash
brew install sox
```
If the app does not start or macOS reports it as “damaged,” remove the quarantine attribute:
```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/pi-carplay.app
```
